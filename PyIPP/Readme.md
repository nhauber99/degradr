# Wrapper for the demosaicing methods contained in the Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP)
For building the Intel Integrated Performance Primitives Python wrapper, which is needed for demosaicing, please download the IPP libraries (or the whole oneAPI Base Toolkit). Then adapt the additional library and include directories of the Visual Studio project to point to the targeted python version and compile as a Release x64 library. Copy the PyIPP.pyd file somewhere into your pythonpath / adapt the pythonpath. When running into trouble, [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/working-with-c-cpp-python-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) might help which is what I used for creating the wrapper library. 

If building on Linux, you're more or less on your own. However, I've included a build.sh script which works for building it on linux, but unfortunately I haven't figured out how to statically link the libraries, so you'll have to also have to add the Intel IPP lib path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. I also didn't manage to get it to work using setuptools.
